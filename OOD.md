## 3. Database and Configuration Files

### 3.1 Database

We make our data persistent by storing them in `csv` files (see `src/database/` folder):

- **Users**

  - **customers.csv:** Stores all data of all customers. Including user id, login name, login password, and loans

  - **managers:** Stores all data of all manager accounts. Including user id, login name, login password.

- **Accounts**

  - **saving_accounts.csv:** Stores all data of saving_accounts created by customers. Including saving account id, owner id, and balance of three currencies.

  - **stock_accounts.csv:** Stores all data of stock accounts created by customers. Including stock account id, owner id, balance of US Dollar, and realized and unrealized profit.

  - **checking_accounts.csv:** Stores all data of checking_accounts created by customers. Including checking account id, owner id, and balance of three currencies.

- **Other entities**

  - **loans.csv:** Stores all data of all loans created by manager. Including loan id, loan name, loan interest rate, and the value that customer can get.

  - **logs.csv:** Stores all transactions of all customers and manager. Including type, transaction id, user id, action time, action content

  - **stocks.csv:** Stores all data of stocks created by managers. Including stock id, name, and current price

For each account, we save it with the ID of user which it belongs to. In this way, when reading a user from database, we can find his or her accounts via the user ID.



### 3.2 Configuration File

We make options like exchange rate and interest rate configurable by storing them in a `csv` file (see `src/configs/config.csv`). Our code will load options from configuration file automatically. In this way, people can edit these options in the configuration file easily.



## 4. Some of the Design Patterns

### 4.1 Proxy Pattern

Class `DatabaseFile` handles file creating and fetching. While `DatabaseFileProxy` is a wrapper of the real  `DatabaseFile` object which implements additional functionality to check if the file has already been created and fetched. In this way, a client (a Data Access Object class) can can elegantly avoid creating file instance duplicately when accessing `DatabaseFile`.

### 4.2 Data Access Object Pattern

To handle database file (`csv`) IO elegantly, we uses Data Access Object pattern to provide data accessing APIs for saving and loading data without exposing details of the database. We implements a Data Access Object (DAO) class for each entity that should be saved into the database, including Stock class, Log class, Config class, Loan class, all types of User classes and all types of Account classes.



![object](./images/dao.svg)



We take class `Stock`, `Manager` and `StockDao` as an example. After editting a stock, `Manager` can easily query the stock by name and save the updated stock information into the database by:

```java
public final class Manager extends User {
	// some code...
  
  public boolean adjustStockPrice(String name, double price) {
    Stock stock = stockDao.queryByName(name);  // query stock
  	// some code...
    stockDao.saveToDatabase();  // update database
    return true;
  }	
  
  // some code...
}
```

All IO operations have been encapsulated into `StockDao` class, so `Manager` doesn't need to know the details of how to save and load data to and from the database.



### 4.3 Observer Pattern

We add interest to customers' saving accounts every month and prompt customers to pay off their loans after one year. So we need a way to computing time and notice related objects (like `SavingAccount`) continually.



![object](./images/observer.svg)



We implement this using Observer Pattern. We first define a `TimeObserver` interface:

```java
public interface TimerObserver {
	void onTimeChange();
	// some code...
}
```

All observers (classes that would like to receive a notice when time change, like `SavingAccount`) need to implement this interface and add itself to `BankTimer` class's observer list:

```java
public final class SavingAccount extends BasicAccount implements TimerObserver {
  // some code...
  @Override
  public void onTimeChange() {
    // ADD INTEREST! 
  }
}
```

`BankTimer` implements interface `Runnable` and override `run()` so it can run continually. It sends a notice to its observer list when time change:

```java
public class BankTimer implements Runnable {
  // some code...
  
  @Override
  public void run() {
    // some code and conditions...
    for (TimerObserver observer : observerList) {
      observer.onTimeChange();  // call its observers' onTimeChange function
      // some code...
    }
  }
}
```



### 4.4 Singleton Pattern

Every DAO class also uses Singleton Pattern to ensure it has only one instance. Here we also take `StockDao` as an example. We hide the contructor of the `StockDao` class by:

```java
public final class StockDao extends Dao<Stock> {
  private static StockDao stockDao = new StockDao();

  private StockDao() {
    // some code...
  }

  public static StockDao getInstance() {
    return stockDao;
  }
  
  // some code...
}
```

A sole instance of class `StockDao` can be obtained by:

```java
private StockDao stockDao = StockDao.getInstance();
```

`BankTimer` (a class for handling time continually) also uses Singleton Pattern, because only one `BankTimer` object is required in the whole system, of course.
